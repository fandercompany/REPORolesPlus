### Descrtiption
This mod is just an addition to the existing REPO Roles, but with more content.
There are 6 roles in this mod: Tank, Runner, Gambler (7 subroles), Strongman, Ranged Looter, Athlete, Loser. 

Tank: has 200 HP and a bit more strength than usual.
Runner: Runs many times faster than normal.
Gambler: Gets buffs and debuffs (7 different variations)
Strongman: can drag heavy objects alone.
Ranged Looter: reaches objects from afar.
Athlete: Runs fast and jumps high.
Normal: Literally nothing. It's better than getting a debuff :)
